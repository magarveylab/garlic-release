A description of how the HYBRID/PK/NRP bar charts were created,
those that show the results of garlic used to compare all sequences against all compounds.

-Mclean Edwards

Throughout, and for file generation, there are three streams of processing.
These are HYBRID, PK, and NRP.
The keyword WHICH should be substituted with each of these in turn.

Aside from garlic, the parameters and directories used are listed at the top of the script files.
Modify these as appropriate.

Step 1: Filter PRISM outputs by length and quality, and categorize into WHICH
This is done by creating text file lists.
Run the modified garlic programs for each stream, capturing the output in seperate lists.
java -jar garlicGenWHICHList -q <json_directory> -s <same_json_directory> > WHICHbiglist.txt

These modified garlic files simply go through all provided PRISM json files
in the input directory and print out only those clusters in WHICH which have 4 or more domains
and are verified as complete.

Step 2:  Run garlic using grid computing
Use the grid script bigrun.sh and bigrun.sub to run each prism file in WHICHbiglist.txt
against the entire compound database using garlic.

On the grid:
bash bigrun.sh

This outputs results for each sequence in a separate file in WHICH subdirectories.

Step 3: Create comparison matrices/spreadsheets using garlic outputs.
Run the script bringtogether.sh

bash bringtogether.sh

This script creates a giant csv file for WHICH which takes all garlic outputs
and combines them into a large csv comparison matrix file for WHICH, comparing the 
match scores of all sequences (by PRISM output) to all compounds (by GRAPE output).

Four matrix files are created, for score, relative_score, raw_score, and sugarscore.


Step 4:  Generate the histograms
Run genHistograms.py for WHICH, modifying the script to use WHICH.

python genHistograms.py

This will create a number of histogram pdf files.
By default, this script uses the relative score.
